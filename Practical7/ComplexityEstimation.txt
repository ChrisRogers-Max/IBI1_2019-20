for the definition of alsit line:
numbers in the amount of N are randomly chosen
O(n) where n=N

the for list which change the range of randomly generated numeber:
still O(n)

the process of itertolls permutaion including pick up 2 or 3 numbers:
all lenear process:
O(n)

To summerize, O(n)+O(n)+O(n)+O(n)=O(n).
So the complexity of the programme would increase with the grow amount of input in a lenear way
